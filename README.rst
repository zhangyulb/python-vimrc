MY VIM CONFIG FOR PYTHON AND C
==============================

VIM Configuration for Python / Cython / C Development.

This repo borrows tons of stuff from ets-labs/python-vimrc. Thanks for sharing!

Requirements
------------

- VIM 7.4+ with python2.7 support
- git
- bash 3.2+

How does it look?
-----------------

.. image:: https://github.com/ets-labs/python-vimrc/wiki/img/screenshot.png

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash
  mv ~/.vim ~/.vim-old && mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc-old
  git clone https://github.com/zhangyulb/python-vimrc.git
  cd python-vimrc && sh setup.sh
  
During execution of init script do not worry about error messages. When it
occurs just press enter and wait till all plugins are installed.

After that, install ctags support:

.. code-block:: bash
   apt-get install exuberant-ctags

Autocompletion
--------------

Current bundle use one of the most comprehensive plugins for autocompletion - 
`Valloric/YouCompleteMe <https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe>`_.
YouCompleteMe autocompletion plugin requires additional installation that 
depends on environment and functionality you want to have. Detailed 
instructions could be found on plugin page: 
`Valloric/YouCompleteMe <https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation>`_.


**Note:** Installation for Ubuntu with support of clang compiler looks like 
this:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/install.py --clang-completer

Key bindings
============

This configuration tends to use standard VIM and installed plugins key 
bindings, but there are some custom key bindings as well:

.. code::

    # Common key bindings:
    
    let mapleader=","                 # more friendly than '\'

    nmap <F2> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>     # Toggle nerd tree
    
    nmap <F3> :BufExplorer<CR>        # Toggle buffer explorer
    
    nmap <F5> :call Run()<CR>         # Run current file      

    nmap <leader>bd :Bclose<cr>:tabclose<cr>gT  # delete current buffer
    nmap <leader>ba :bufdo bd<cr>               # delete all buffers
    nmap <leader>l  :bnext<cr>                  # to next buffer
    nmap <leader>h  :bprevious<cr>              # to previous buffer

    # Python mode key bindings:

    let g:pymode_doc_key='K'
    let g:pymode_breakpoint_key='<leader>b'
    let g:pymode_run_bind='<F5>'

    nmap <leader>g :YcmCompleter GoTo<CR>
    nmap <leader>d :YcmCompleter GoToDefinition<CR>
